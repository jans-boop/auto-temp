Thanks to [@seancze](https://www.github.com/seancze/) for fixing the scheduler!

Tired of updating temperature? This automates it for you!
And by automate, I mean you only have to **run the script once** if you're feeling well!
If you're not, please stop the script and record your temperature manually!

``Disclaimer: Please only use if you are sure that you are fine.
